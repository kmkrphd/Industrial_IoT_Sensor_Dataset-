About the Dataset
The Industrial IoT Sensor Dataset consists of 4993 samples collected at a half-hourly interval from January 2022 onwards, representing real-world industrial environments where sensor-driven AI plays a crucial role. Each record corresponds to a unique sensor ID, ensuring traceability of specific monitoring devices. The dataset captures sensor-based environmental conditions, including temperature (ranging from -10°C to 50°C), vibration intensity (0 to 5 units), and pressure levels (0.5 to 10 bars), essential for monitoring machine health and operational efficiency. The operational status attribute classifies machines into Operational, Maintenance, or Failure states, providing critical insights into system performance. The dataset includes energy consumption data (100 kWh to 2000 kWh), allowing AI models to optimize power efficiency. A fault flag (8% anomaly rate) is incorporated to mark system failures, ensuring a realistic scenario for predictive maintenance modeling. The decision label classifies machine conditions into Optimal, Degraded, or Failure states, supporting real-time anomaly detection and risk assessment. This dataset is ideal for training advanced AI models in fault prediction, adaptive industrial control, and resource optimization ensuring high generalizability and ethical compliance with industrial safety and AI fairness standards.

Ethical Compliance of Accumulated Dataset
The Industrial IoT Sensor Dataset has been structured with a strong ethical foundation, focusing on safety, reliability, and non-discriminatory AI applications in industrial automation. This dataset comprises sensor-based machine health parameters, including temperature, pressure, vibration, and energy consumption, ensuring that the data is collected from machine-driven, non-personal sources. The dataset is built to reflect real-world industrial operations, ensuring AI models trained on this data are practically applicable for predictive maintenance and fault detection. The anomaly and fault flags are generated based on realistic system failure distributions, making the dataset unbiased and ethically sound for AI-driven risk assessment and industrial safety applications. Furthermore, the dataset adheres to industrial ethical standards ensuring that AI models derived from it contribute to transparent, reliable, and responsible industrial automation without biases or unfair decision-making.
